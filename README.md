# SampleBluetoothApp
Implement the following functions as outlined by your UML diagram. Make any
assumptions necessary - but please provide your assumptions, imports are not required.
Please be specific to BLE and the OS of the role you applied for (iOS or Android only).
Discover available EP1’s 
Connect to a discovered Mailbox
b)   Authenticate user
c)   Send unlock command

3) Connect to discovered EP1 – You can do just a diagram and maybe some code around the BLE Connectivity 

Assumptions:
1: I treated the Ep1's as discoverable by bluetooth like any other peripheral
2: For authentication I used local authentication via touch id, something I could see for logging into an account that controls EP1's
3: "Send unlock command" means send data of some kind to the peripheral, which I could not implement because I don't have second device to test it on
